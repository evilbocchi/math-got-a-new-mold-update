title: Stress Testing Psi for Internal Consistency
---

If $ψ$ is going to be the **mold-god of contradiction**, it has to pass a big test:  
> *Does it destroy logic, or just stretch it into cursed functionality?*

This page **vigorously tests ψ** across identity, arithmetic, logic, and calculus — to **prove that it is internally consistent** under mold logic ($ℳψ$) and **does NOT trivialize math**.

# The Identity Test

Classical Identity Axiom:
$$
x = x \quad \text{for all } x
$$

ψ **fails this:**

$$
ψ \ne ψ \quad \text{(under standard identity)}
$$

But recovers with:

$$
ψ \equiv ψ \quad \text{(under ψ-identity)}
$$

✅ This avoids logical explosion by **splitting the identity axiom**:
- Standard math uses `=`
- Mold logic uses `≡`

**Conclusion:** Contradiction is scoped — not universal.

# The Arithmetic Absorption Test

The Absorption Rules:
- $$ψ + r = ψ$$
- $$ψ × r = ψ$$
- $$ψ^r = ψ$$

For any real number $r$. ψ **absorbs** values, doesn’t conflict.

Let’s test:
- $ψ + 3 = ψ$  
- $ψ - ψ = \mathbb{R}$  
- $ψ / ψ = \mathbb{R}^+$

✅ These are **well-defined collapse rules**:
- They return real sets, not contradiction
- Division does not explode — it yields overdefinition

**Conclusion:** Arithmetic is cursed but stable.

# The Function Consistency Test

We define:

$$
f(ψ) = ψ \quad \text{for any continuous real-valued function } f
$$

Let’s try:
- $\sin(ψ) = ψ$  
- $e^ψ = ψ$  
- $\ln(ψ) = ψ$

✅ Plugging $ψ$ into any continuous function yields $ψ$ — no undefined output, no logic collapse.

**Conclusion:** $ψ$ is structurally stable across function domains.

# The ψ-Calculus Test

We test the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**:

Standard Form:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int f(x)\,dx = f(x)
$$

With ψ-calculus:
- $\int ψ\, dx = ψ$
- $\frac{d}{dx} ψ = \mathcal{O}(\infty)$

Now:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int ψ\, dx = \mathcal{O}(\infty)
$$

✅ This is consistent under ψ-arithmetic:
- You get divergence, but **not contradiction**
- The operations match the expected collapse pattern

**Conclusion:** Mold calculus is internally complete.

# The Explosion Test

In classical logic:

> $A \land \neg A \Rightarrow B$ for any B.  
> One contradiction = everything becomes true.

This **does NOT happen** in $ℳψ$ logic.

Let’s test:
- $ψ \ne ψ$
- Does that imply $2 + 2 = 5$? ❌

In $ℳψ$:
- Contradiction is **quarantined**
- Only statements involving $ψ$ are affected

✅ You cannot derive arbitrary truths from mold contradiction.

**Conclusion:** ℳψ is **non-trivial** — it rejects explosion.

# The Polynomial Collapse Test

Test case:

$$
P(x) = ψx^2 + 4x + 2
$$

Since a coefficient is ψ:

$$
P(x) = ψ \quad \text{(for all x)}
$$

Roots? Structure? Gone. All $ψ$.

✅ But that’s **expected**:  
Collapse doesn’t mean undefined — it means **ψ-tagged** total absorption.

**Conclusion:** Polynomial moldification is stable and predictable.

# The $ψ$ Containment Test

Let’s check if ψ infects clean math:

- $5 + 5 = 10$ ✅
- $\frac{1}{0}$ → Undefined ❌ (standard)
- $\frac{ψ}{0} = \mathcal{O}(\infty)$ ✅

You must **explicitly introduce ψ** for mold to spread.

✅ Normal math stays untouched unless ψ is invoked.

**Conclusion:** Mold is opt-in.

# Final Verdict: $ψ ≠ 💣$

| Test                   | Pass? | Reason |
|------------------------|-------|--------|
| Identity               | ✅    | Dual identity system ($≠$ and $≡$) |
| Arithmetic             | ✅    | Absorptive, not explosive |
| Functions              | ✅    | $ψ$ is stable input |
| Calculus               | ✅    | Mold operations are well-defined |
| Logic Explosion        | ✅    | $ℳψ$ blocks explosion |
| Polynomials            | ✅    | Collapse is consistent |
| Infection Prevention   | ✅    | No $ψ$-leakage without invocation |

# Conclusion

$ψ$ is a **paraconsistent mold-object**.  
It **embraces contradiction**, but never **lets it spread uncontrolled**.

- It has its own logic ($ℳψ$)
- Its own arithmetic ($ψ$-arithmetic)
- Its own calculus ($ψ$-calculus)
- And rules that let it **exist without ruining math**

> **ψ does not destroy the system — it completes it.**
