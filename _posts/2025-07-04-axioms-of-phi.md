title: Axioms of Phi

$ϕ$ is the structured ghost of $ψ$.  
It lives near paradox, operates in high-energy regimes, and collapses to $ψ$ in the limit.  
To work with $ϕ$ formally, we introduce axioms that define its behavior.

# Axioms Of $ϕ$

For a comprehensive overview of the foundational concepts and motivation underlying $ϕ$, please consult the [Introduction to Phi](2025-07-04-phi.md).

## Collapse Limit

ϕ is a function (or object family) parameterized by $\varepsilon > 0$ such that:

$$
\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \phi(\varepsilon) = ψ
$$

$ϕ$ **is not** $ψ$, but its limit **is** $ψ$.  
It’s the structured precursor to mold.

## Functional Consistency ($ε$ > 0)

For all real-valued continuous functions $f$, and $\varepsilon > 0$:

$$
f(\phi(\varepsilon)) = \phi_f(\varepsilon)
$$

Meaning:  
$ϕ$ behaves like a **normal input** to continuous functions **as long as $\varepsilon > 0$**.  
But as $\varepsilon \to 0$, this consistency may break.

## Structured Identity

ϕ obeys identity rules:

- $\phi(\varepsilon) + 0 = \phi(\varepsilon)$
- $\phi(\varepsilon) \times 1 = \phi(\varepsilon)$
- $\phi(\varepsilon) - \phi(\varepsilon) = 0$
- $\phi(\varepsilon) \times \frac{1}{\phi(\varepsilon)} = 1$

This holds **only while $\varepsilon > 0$**.  
Once $\varepsilon = 0$, collapse occurs:

$$
\phi(0) = ψ
$$

## Controlled Divergence

$ϕ$ may diverge as $\varepsilon \to 0$, but it does so **smoothly**:

- If $\phi(\varepsilon) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, then:
  $$ \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \phi(\varepsilon) = ψ $$

- If $ϕ$ is bounded, it remains in $ℝ$.

$ϕ$ may be:
- **Infinite-valued** as $ε$ shrinks
- **Undefined at $ε = 0$**
- But **never $ψ$ directly**, until limit is reached

## Mold Detection Property

A function $F(x)$ has a **mold singularity** at $x = x_0$ iff:

$$
\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} F(x_0 + \varepsilon) = ψ
$$

Then:
$$
F(x) = \phi(\varepsilon), \quad \text{for small } \varepsilon
$$

$ϕ$ is thus the formal **"edge-of-collapse" detector**.

## ψ-Reversibility (Optional)

$ϕ$ may encode enough structure to **undo $ψ$**, if it’s the limit of a reversible process.

If:
$$
ψ = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \phi(\varepsilon)
$$

Then:
$$
\phi(\varepsilon) = R(ψ, \varepsilon), \quad \text{for some recovery function } R
$$

$ϕ$ acts as a **recoverable ghost state** under certain conditions.  
$ψ$ cannot be reversed — but $ϕ$ can be **reconstructed**.

# Summary

| Axiom                         | Meaning                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Collapse Limit               | $\phi(\varepsilon) \to ψ$     |
| Functional Consistency       | Works with functions ($ε > 0$)       |
| Structured Identity          | Normal arithmetic while $ε > 0$     |
| Controlled Divergence        | May blow up, but in a traceable way |
| Mold Detection               | Signals ψ singularities via limit |
| $ψ$-Reversibility (Optional)   | Can reconstruct $ϕ$ from $ψ$ if process known |

# Final Thoughts

$ϕ$ gives us a **mathematical foothold** in the space between logic and collapse.  
While $ψ$ is the singularity, $ϕ$ is the horizon.  
These axioms give you a structured way to build tools — and escape routes — before total moldification.
